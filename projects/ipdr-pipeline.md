Dealing with large-scale data processing is always a challenge, especially when the daily volume surpasses 6TB of raw data, equivalent to 40+ billion records per day. In one of my recent projects, we had to design and implement a robust data processing framework that could handle this scale while ensuring reliability, automation, and business impact.
### Business Goal
The primary objective of this project was to provide actionable insights into customer data usage behavior. By analyzing usage patterns, the business could make more informed decisions on customer engagement, product optimization, and targeted offerings.
This required not just raw data ingestion but also timely transformation, processing, and aggregation of billions of records to serve downstream analytics and business intelligence tools.
### Core Architecture
The backbone of the system was built around two key technologies:
**Apache Spark** – Spark was chosen as the core processing engine due to its ability to efficiently handle massive datasets with distributed computing. Its in-memory computation made it well-suited for iterative workloads and transformations across billions of rows.

**Apache Airflow** – To orchestrate workflows, schedule jobs, and manage dependencies, we used Airflow. It ensured that all pipelines ran in the correct sequence and handled retries gracefully in case of failures.

### Key Features of the Framework
- Scalable Data Processing
The Spark-based processing pipelines were designed to handle 6TB+ of daily data without performance bottlenecks.
Data transformations were optimized with partitioning, caching strategies, and shuffle management to ensure cost and time efficiency.
- Workflow Orchestration with Airflow
All workflows were modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Airflow.
Each DAG defined task dependencies clearly, which helped in ensuring end-to-end pipeline reliability.
Airflow also provided extensive monitoring through its UI, making it easy to track task execution and performance.
- Notification & Alerting Mechanism
A built-in notification system was integrated to alert the team in case of failures, performance degradation, or SLA breaches.
Notifications were sent via email and messaging platforms, enabling quicker response times.
- Backlog & Recovery Processing
The framework was designed to reprocess backlogs or missing jobs for up to 7 days.
This capability was critical to maintaining data completeness, especially in scenarios where upstream data sources had delays or outages.
- Business-Centric Output
At the end of each processing cycle, aggregated datasets and insights were delivered to downstream systems for BI dashboards, customer segmentation models, and operational teams.
### Skills & Tools Applied
Programming: Python was the core programming language for both Spark applications and Airflow DAGs.
Big Data Processing: Apache Spark served as the data engine to process 40+ billion records daily.
Workflow Automation: Apache Airflow orchestrated, scheduled, and monitored all workflows in a highly reliable way.
### Conclusion
Handling 6TB+ of data and 40 billion records daily is no small feat. With Spark for processing and Airflow for orchestration, we were able to design a scalable, reliable, and business-driven data framework. This system not only met current business needs but also provided a strong foundation for future growth and more advanced analytics use cases.
